  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>(Optimization, Operations Research, Probablistic Modelling, Python, Tkinter)</em></p>

<p>This calculator was built based on the assumption that within a given Social Network, friends of a given person has an effect on the probability of that person clicking an advertisement. This calculator evaluates a scenario where advertisements are split up between two stages, with the second stage being affected by what has occured in the first stage.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>(Moodle, AWS, Management, Non-Profit)</em></p>

<p>eLearn Caribbean is an online platform dedicated to providing free education to the Caribbean region. In 2018, 11000 students were awarded no passes in the very critical CXC examination. I am currently creating a Non-Profit Organization based on the overwhelmingly positive feedback received.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>(Digital Signal Processing, Audio Analysis, Image Analysis, MATLAB)</em></p>

<p>This system was designed and developed to counteract acoustic disintegration of sound waves as they propagate from a speaker to an audience. This was done through the use of Image Analysis to detect the audience &amp; Audio Analysis to examine audio features.</p>

</ul>

<p><em>(Agile Development, Project Management, Systems Designing/Creation)</em></p>

<p>While employed at CET (Caribbean Entertainment Technologies), I worked alongside teams &amp; oversaw projects. These projects are private and cannot be openly displayed. However, the technologies and techniques used in carrying out these projects are discussed such as: Systems Design, Agile Development &amp; Programming Languages.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>(Microcontroller, PIC, C, Sensor Design, Circuit Design, Testing/Analysis)</em></p>

<p>The created system was able to detect the heart-rate &amp; glucose level of an individual, store the data, and give out an alarm if the heart rate drops below a certain threshold. A keypad &amp; LCD display was used as means of system interaction.</p>
