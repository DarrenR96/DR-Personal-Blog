<p>This calculator utilizes a dynamic approach to optimally (maximization) allocate advertisements across a Bi-stage Advertisement Campaign and calculate the expected number of clicks for that assignment.

<em>Optimal Impression Calculator</em></p>

<h3 id="operation">Operation</h3>

<p>Basically the scenario is this: For a given person (node) in an Online Social Network (OSN) who has friends represented by edges connected to another node; the probability of that node clicking an advertisement is partially dependent on the actions of that node’s friends when they are presented with the same advertisement. So think of a someone named Tom who has three friends: Kim, Joe &amp; Jill. Suppose the advert was shown to Joe intially and Joe clicked on it. Because of this, the likelihood of Tom clicking the advert will be increased.</p>

<p>The equation to update the probability of a given node is defined as follows:</p>

<p><img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?p%20%5Cleftarrow%20max%5C%7B0%2C%20min%5C%7B0.25%20+%20%5Calpha*%28%5Cfrac%7Bn%7D%7Bf%7D%29%20%5C%7D%20%5C%7D" alt="alt text" title="Update Probability Equation" /></p>

<p>Where alpha is a given scaling constant, (in this case 0.15). n is the total number of friends of a given node that clicked an impression when it was shown to them. f is the total number of a friends for the user under examination.</p>

<p>For more information about this check out this paper: <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-89932-9_4">On the Problem of Multi-Staged Impression Allocation in Online Social Networks</a>, done by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/inzamam-rahaman-721b40b8/">Inzamam Rahaman</a> and <a href="http://hosein.tt">Patrick Hosein</a>.</p>

<p>The front end was created entirely utilizing Tkinter, with matplotlib being used for graphing the networks. The backend of the program was done using an object oriented approach and <a href="https://networkx.github.io/">NetworkX</a>. To determine the optimal allocaiton; all allocations were have to be considered. The basic flow diagram for calculating the Expectation of the number of clicks based on the impression allocation is shown below.</p>
