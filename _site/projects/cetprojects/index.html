<p>Projects taken here were private and cannot be displayed, however a small discussion on some techniques used in these projcets is presented.</p>

<h3 id="systems-design">Systems Design</h3>

<p>One of the key activities that were done repeatedly whilst employed here was designing systems. Here the specifications from the project were taken and analyzed. Then, given the nature of the project, a systems diagram was produced, mostly using AutoCAD or Visio. These systems were typically a combination of both Hardware and Software components.</p>

<h3 id="project-management">Project Management</h3>

<p>I worked alongside an experienced Systems Engineer where we assisted each other in the design, deployment, logistics &amp; business side of things. We also came in contact and had to work alongside other companies/organizations to fully deploy a system. Typically on deployment, the engineers and a team of technicans would go onsite to seamlessly deploy the system. The logistics and business processes were done through report software and excel sheets typically.</p>

<h3 id="software-development">Software Development</h3>

<p>The prevelant software cycle used was Agile Development. It was key that a good rapport with the client was to be maintained at all times. I worked on a total of 3 projects with this cycle. I also created custom applications utilizing Python &amp; the MERN stack. Again, I cannot go to in detail on these projects, but I can say that I had to create and link a database system with some back-end processing to
achieve tasks.</p>
