## PROJECTS

- ### [Optimal Impression Calculator for Multi-Stage Advertisement Campaigns on Social Media](/projects/optimalImpressionCalculator)

_(Optimization, Operations Research, Probablistic Modelling, Python, Tkinter)_

This calculator was built based on the assumption that within a given Social Network, friends of a given person has an effect on the probability of that person clicking an advertisement. This calculator evaluates a scenario where advertisements are split up between two stages, with the second stage being affected by what has occured in the first stage.

- ### [Realtime Auto Equalizaiton System Based on Acoustic & Visual Feedback](/projects/autoeq)

_(Digital Signal Processing, Audio Analysis, Image Analysis, MATLAB)_

This system was designed and developed to counteract acoustic disintegration of sound waves as they propagate from a speaker to an audience. This was done through the use of Image Analysis to detect the audience & Audio Analysis to examine audio features.

- ### [MicroController Based Pulse & Glucose Monitor](/projects/micromonitor)

_(Microcontroller, PIC, C, Sensor Design, Circuit Design, Testing/Analysis)_

The created system was able to detect the heart-rate & glucose level of an individual, store the data, and give out an alarm if the heart rate drops below a certain threshold. A keypad & LCD display was used as means of system interaction.
