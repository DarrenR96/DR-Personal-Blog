## eLearn Caribbean - Online Learning Platform for the Caribbean

### Personal Project

In 2015, I was awarded a Mathematics National Scholarship by the Government of Trinidad & Tobago due to my performance in the Advanced Proficiency Examinations (CAPE). This is what allowed me to gain a tertiary education and gave me a new horizon of oppurtunities. Being forever thankful to my country for giving me this, it was truly saddening to see the [crime rate rising](https://www.ttcrime.com/crime-statistics/) across the country. Upon realizing this, I began thinking of ways that I could affect even one person and give that person an oppurunity just as I had been given one. This was the key inspiration of a completely free education platform.  
You can read more about the platform as published by the Newsday [here](https://newsday.co.tt/2018/09/09/schol-winner-gives-back/).

### Technologies Used

The platform, [elearnCaribbean](http://www.elearncaribbean.com/), was published to give everyone an equal chance. In doing so, the U.I. had to be clean, easy and understandable for all possible user classes. It was built upon the open source learning management system [Moodle Framework](https://moodle.org/). This framework had built in modules handling courses, categories, forums, quizzes and most things needed. The system was deployed on an [EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) instance on Amazon Web Services. This allowed for a scalable deployment which meant that the price vary based on the traffic needed by the site. With the CAPE/CXC exams being bi-annually, the traffic would see a significant decrease after up until around at the midpoint between these both exam offerings.

### Educational Content

Right now, all the video content for the subjects are done by me. This came easy to me as I have a love for teaching and seeing people learn new things. However with my Master's, Work, and ongoing research, it has been a little tough with answering any questions in a timely manner. If you'd like to help with this, please [email me](mailto:darrenramsook@outlook.com "Email").
