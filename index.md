Hi! My name is Darren Ramsook & I'm an Electrical & Computer Engineer with a keen interest in audio and image signal processing. This interest in Audio/Image processing is mainly due to the arts having a special place in my heart & also because I'm an avid [musician](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eQwDnTptmY).  
Currently I am pursuing my MSc. in Data Science at the Univeristy of the West Indies (UWI). I combine my love for signal processing, software engineering and data science to help systems better analyze the world around us.
